    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 Tbsp Chili Powder</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp Paprika (Smoked if possible)</li>
      <li>1/2 Tbsp Cumin Powder</li>
      <li>2 tsp Onion Powder</li>
      <li>2 tsp Garlic Powder</li>
      <li>2 tsp Black Pepper</li>
      <li>1 tsp Salt</li>
      <li>2 pinch Oregano</li>
      <li>6-8 Burrito Size Tortillas</li>
      <li>16 oz Fat Free Cottage Cheese</li>
      <li>1 lbs 93% Lean Ground Turkey</li>
      <li>2 cups Spinach, chopped (or leafy green of your choice)</li>
      <li>18 lg Eggs, beaten</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Heat large skillet on medium heat.</li>
      <li>While skillet is heating, combine all seasonings in small dish.</li>
      <li>
        Add <em>all</em> ground turkey, seasonings, spinage, and cottage cheese.
      </li>
      <li>Cook until thickened, stiring occasionally.</li>
      <li>
        Once mixture has thickend, there are no chucks of cottage cheese
        remaining, and there is very little liquid left, transfer it to a large
        dish to cool. I prefer a glass casorle dish.
      </li>
      <li>Turn heat down to med/low and add eggs.</li>
      <li>Gently stir until thoroughly cooked and scrambled.</li>
      <li>Once cooked, transfer to large bowl to cool.</li>
      <li>
        Allow meat and eggs to cool a little, then portion out to burritos as
        desired.
      </li>
      <li>
        Wrap and store burritos. Can be frozen and thawed days later for easy
        meal prep.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      <strong>Tip for even portions:</strong> I like to get out a third large
      bowl and place that on my kitchen scale. I zero it out and then combine
      both the egg and turkey mixtures in it. I can mix it all in there too.
      Then I check the weight and devide that by how many burritos I want to
      make.
